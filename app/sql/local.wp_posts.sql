Lorem Ipsum е индустриален стандарт от около 1500 година, когато неизвестен печатар взема няколко печатарски букви и ги разбърква, за да напечата с тях книга с примерни шрифтове. Този начин не само е оцелял повече от 5 века, но е навлязъл и в публикуването на електронни издания като е запазен почти без промяна. Популяризиран е през 60те години на 20ти век със издаването на Letraset листи, съдържащи Lorem Ipsum пасажи, популярен е и в наши дни във софтуер за печатни издания като Aldus PageMaker, който включва различни версии на Lorem Ipsum.\n\nCatalà\n\nLorem Ipsum és un text de farciment usat per la indústria de la tipografia i la impremta. Lorem Ipsum ha estat el text estàndard de la indústria des de l\'any 1500, quan un impressor desconegut va fer servir una galerada de text i la va mesclar per crear un llibre de mostres tipogràfiques. No només ha sobreviscut cinc segles, sinó que ha fet el salt cap a la creació de tipus de lletra electrònics, romanent essencialment sense canvis. Es va popularitzar l\'any 1960 amb el llançament de fulls Letraset que contenien passatges de Lorem Ipsum, i més recentment amb programari d\'autoedició com Aldus Pagemaker que inclou versions de Lorem Ipsum.\n\nHrvatski\n\nLorem Ipsum je jednostavno probni tekst koji se koristi u tiskarskoj i slovoslagarskoj industriji. Lorem Ipsum postoji kao industrijski standard još od 16-og stoljeća, kada je nepoznati tiskar uzeo tiskarsku galiju slova i posložio ih da bi napravio knjigu s uzorkom tiska. Taj je tekst ne samo preživio pet stoljeća, već se i vinuo u svijet elektronskog slovoslagarstva, ostajući u suštini nepromijenjen. Postao je popularan tijekom 1960-ih s pojavom Letraset listova s odlomcima Lorem Ipsum-a, a u skorije vrijeme sa software-om za stolno izdavaštvo kao što je Aldus PageMaker koji također sadrži varijante Lorem Ipsum-a.\n\nČesky\n\nLorem Ipsum je demonstrativní výplňový text používaný v tiskařském a knihařském průmyslu. Lorem Ipsum je považováno za standard v této oblasti už od začátku 16. století, kdy dnes neznámý tiskař vzal kusy textu a na jejich základě vytvořil speciální vzorovou knihu. Jeho odkaz nevydržel pouze pět století, on přežil i nástup elektronické sazby v podstatě beze změny. Nejvíce popularizováno bylo Lorem Ipsum v šedesátých letech 20. století, kdy byly vydávány speciální vzorníky s jeho pasážemi a později pak díky počítačovým DTP programům jako Aldus PageMaker.\n\nRomâna\n\nLorem Ipsum este pur şi simplu o machetă pentru text a industriei tipografice. Lorem Ipsum a fost macheta standard a industriei încă din secolul al XVI-lea, când un tipograf anonim a luat o planşetă de litere şi le-a amestecat pentru a crea o carte demonstrativă pentru literele respective. Nu doar că a supravieţuit timp de cinci secole, dar şi a facut saltul în tipografia electronică practic neschimbată. A fost popularizată în anii \'60 odată cu ieşirea colilor Letraset care conţineau pasaje Lorem Ipsum, iar mai recent, prin programele de publicare pentru calculator, ca Aldus PageMaker care includeau versiuni de Lorem Ipsum.\n\nСрпски\n\nLorem Ipsum је једноставно модел текста који се користи у штампарској и словослагачкој индустрији. Lorem ipsum је био стандард за модел текста још од 1500. године, када је непознати штампар узео кутију са словима и сложио их како би направио узорак књиге. Не само што је овај модел опстао пет векова, него је чак почео да се користи и у електронским медијима, непроменивши се. Популаризован је шездесетих година двадесетог века заједно са листовима летерсета који су садржали Lorem Ipsum пасусе, а данас са софтверским пакетом за прелом као што је Aldus PageMaker који је садржао Lorem Ipsum верзије.","Lorem Ipsum","","trash","closed","closed","","lorem-ipsum__trashed","","","2018-08-07 18:38:35","2018-08-07 18:38:35","",0,"https://wpthemetestdata.wordpress.com/lorem-ipsum/",7,"page","",0),

It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.\n\nIf you could keep awake (but of course you can\'t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.\n\nI don\'t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person\'s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child\'s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.\n\nOf course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John\'s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other\'s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.\n\nOf all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.\n\nOccasionally in her travels through her children\'s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael\'s minds, while Wendy\'s began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.","Post Format: Standard","","trash","closed","closed","","post-format-standard__trashed","","","2018-08-07 18:50:37","2018-08-07 18:50:37","",0,"https://wpthemetestdata.wordpress.com/?p=358",0,"post","",0),

The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let\'s get started.\n\nOn the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose from the options of <em>None</em>, <em>Left</em>, <em>Right, </em>and <em>Center</em>. In addition, they also get the options of <em>Thumbnail</em>, <em>Medium</em>, <em>Large</em> &amp; <em>Fullsize</em>.\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-906 aligncenter\" title=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" alt=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"300\" /></p>\nThe image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>.\n\n<strong><img class=\"size-full wp-image-904 alignleft\" title=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" alt=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></strong>The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>. <strong></strong>\n\nAs you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we\'ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it\'s thang. Mission accomplished!\n\nAnd now for a <em><strong>massively large image</strong></em>. It also has <em><strong>no alignment</strong></em>.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-907\" title=\"Image Alignment 1200x400\" alt=\"Image Alignment 1200x400\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002-1.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"400\" />\n\nThe image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-905 alignright\" title=\"Image Alignment 300x200\" alt=\"Image Alignment 300x200\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-300x200.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />\n\nAnd now we\'re going to shift things to the <em><strong>right align</strong></em>. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there... Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don\'t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don\'t let anyone else tell you differently.\n\nIn just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah... Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.\n\nAnd just when you thought we were done, we\'re going to do them all over again with captions!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_906\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"580\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-906  \" title=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" alt=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"300\" /> Look at 580x300 getting some <a title=\"Image Settings\" href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/images/image-settings/\">caption</a> love.[/caption]\n\nThe image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_904\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"150\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-904  \" title=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" alt=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /> Itty-bitty caption.[/caption]\n\n<strong></strong>The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>. <strong></strong>\n\nAs you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image.

The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let\'s get started.\n\nOn the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose from the options of <em>None</em>, <em>Left</em>, <em>Right, </em>and <em>Center</em>. In addition, they also get the options of <em>Thumbnail</em>, <em>Medium</em>, <em>Large</em> &amp; <em>Fullsize</em>.\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-906 aligncenter\" title=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" alt=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"300\" /></p>\nThe image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>.\n\n<strong><img class=\"size-full wp-image-904 alignleft\" title=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" alt=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></strong>The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>. <strong></strong>\n\nAs you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we\'ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it\'s thang.

The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let\'s get started.\n\nOn the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose from the options of <em>None</em>, <em>Left</em>, <em>Right, </em>and <em>Center</em>. In addition, they also get the options of <em>Thumbnail</em>, <em>Medium</em>, <em>Large</em> &amp; <em>Fullsize</em>.\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-906 aligncenter\" title=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" alt=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"300\" /></p>\nThe image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>.\n\n<strong><img class=\"size-full wp-image-904 alignleft\" title=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" alt=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></strong>The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>. <strong></strong>\n\nAs you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we\'ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it\'s thang. Mission accomplished!\n\nAnd now for a <em><strong>massively large image</strong></em>. It also has <em><strong>no alignment</strong></em>.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-907\" title=\"Image Alignment 1200x400\" alt=\"Image Alignment 1200x400\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002-1.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"400\" />\n\nThe image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-905 alignright\" title=\"Image Alignment 300x200\" alt=\"Image Alignment 300x200\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-300x200.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />\n\nAnd now we\'re going to shift things to the <em><strong>right align</strong></em>. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there... Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don\'t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don\'t let anyone else tell you differently.\n\nIn just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah... Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.\n\nAnd just when you thought we were done, we\'re going to do them all over again with captions!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_906\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"580\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-906  \" title=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" alt=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"300\" /> Look at 580x300 getting some <a title=\"Image Settings\" href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/images/image-settings/\">caption</a> love.[/caption]\n\nThe image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>.

Lorem Ipsum е индустриален стандарт от около 1500 година, когато неизвестен печатар взема няколко печатарски букви и ги разбърква, за да напечата с тях книга с примерни шрифтове. Този начин не само е оцелял повече от 5 века, но е навлязъл и в публикуването на електронни издания като е запазен почти без промяна. Популяризиран е през 60те години на 20ти век със издаването на Letraset листи, съдържащи Lorem Ipsum пасажи, популярен е и в наши дни във софтуер за печатни издания като Aldus PageMaker, който включва различни версии на Lorem Ipsum.\n\nCatalà\n\nLorem Ipsum és un text de farciment usat per la indústria de la tipografia i la impremta. Lorem Ipsum ha estat el text estàndard de la indústria des de l\'any 1500, quan un impressor desconegut va fer servir una galerada de text i la va mesclar per crear un llibre de mostres tipogràfiques. No només ha sobreviscut cinc segles, sinó que ha fet el salt cap a la creació de tipus de lletra electrònics, romanent essencialment sense canvis. Es va popularitzar l\'any 1960 amb el llançament de fulls Letraset que contenien passatges de Lorem Ipsum, i més recentment amb programari d\'autoedició com Aldus Pagemaker que inclou versions de Lorem Ipsum.\n\nHrvatski\n\nLorem Ipsum je jednostavno probni tekst koji se koristi u tiskarskoj i slovoslagarskoj industriji. Lorem Ipsum postoji kao industrijski standard još od 16-og stoljeća, kada je nepoznati tiskar uzeo tiskarsku galiju slova i posložio ih da bi napravio knjigu s uzorkom tiska. Taj je tekst ne samo preživio pet stoljeća, već se i vinuo u svijet elektronskog slovoslagarstva, ostajući u suštini nepromijenjen. Postao je popularan tijekom 1960-ih s pojavom Letraset listova s odlomcima Lorem Ipsum-a, a u skorije vrijeme sa software-om za stolno izdavaštvo kao što je Aldus PageMaker koji također sadrži varijante Lorem Ipsum-a.\n\nČesky\n\nLorem Ipsum je demonstrativní výplňový text používaný v tiskařském a knihařském průmyslu. Lorem Ipsum je považováno za standard v této oblasti už od začátku 16. století, kdy dnes neznámý tiskař vzal kusy textu a na jejich základě vytvořil speciální vzorovou knihu. Jeho odkaz nevydržel pouze pět století, on přežil i nástup elektronické sazby v podstatě beze změny. Nejvíce popularizováno bylo Lorem Ipsum v šedesátých letech 20. století, kdy byly vydávány speciální vzorníky s jeho pasážemi a později pak díky počítačovým DTP programům jako Aldus PageMaker.\n\nRomâna\n\nLorem Ipsum este pur şi simplu o machetă pentru text a industriei tipografice. Lorem Ipsum a fost macheta standard a industriei încă din secolul al XVI-lea, când un tipograf anonim a luat o planşetă de litere şi le-a amestecat pentru a crea o carte demonstrativă pentru literele respective. Nu doar că a supravieţuit timp de cinci secole, dar şi a facut saltul în tipografia electronică practic neschimbată. A fost popularizată în anii \'60 odată cu ieşirea colilor Letraset care conţineau pasaje Lorem Ipsum, iar mai recent, prin programele de publicare pentru calculator, ca Aldus PageMaker care includeau versiuni de Lorem Ipsum.\n\nСрпски\n\nLorem Ipsum је једноставно модел текста који се користи у штампарској и словослагачкој индустрији. Lorem ipsum је био стандард за модел текста још од 1500. године, када је непознати штампар узео кутију са словима и сложио их како би направио узорак књиге. Не само што је овај модел опстао пет векова, него је чак почео да се користи и у електронским медијима, непроменивши се. Популаризован је шездесетих година двадесетог века заједно са листовима летерсета који су садржали Lorem Ipsum пасусе, а данас са софтверским пакетом за прелом као што је Aldus PageMaker који је садржао Lorem Ipsum верзије.","Lorem Ipsum","","inherit","closed","closed","","146-revision-v1","","","2018-08-07 18:38:35","2018-08-07 18:38:35","",146,"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/146-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0),

The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let\'s get started.\n\nOn the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose from the options of <em>None</em>, <em>Left</em>, <em>Right, </em>and <em>Center</em>. In addition, they also get the options of <em>Thumbnail</em>, <em>Medium</em>, <em>Large</em> &amp; <em>Fullsize</em>.\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-906 aligncenter\" title=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" alt=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"300\" /></p>\nThe image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>.\n\n<strong><img class=\"size-full wp-image-904 alignleft\" title=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" alt=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></strong>The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>. <strong></strong>\n\nAs you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we\'ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it\'s thang. Mission accomplished!\n\nAnd now for a <em><strong>massively large image</strong></em>. It also has <em><strong>no alignment</strong></em>.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-907\" title=\"Image Alignment 1200x400\" alt=\"Image Alignment 1200x400\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002-1.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"400\" />\n\nThe image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area.

I don\'t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don\'t let anyone else tell you differently.\n\nIn just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah... Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.\n\nAnd just when you thought we were done, we\'re going to do them all over again with captions!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_906\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"580\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-906  \" title=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" alt=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" src=\"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"300\" /> Look at 580x300 getting some <a title=\"Image Settings\" href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/images/image-settings/\">caption</a> love.[/caption]\n\nThe image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>.

Nothing fancy. Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled to pick a side. Leave him be. It will just be better that way. Trust me.\n<h3>Left Align</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">This is a paragraph. It is left aligned. Because of this, it is a bit more liberal in it\'s views. It\'s favorite color is green. Left align tends to be more eco-friendly, but it provides no concrete evidence that it really is. Even though it likes share the wealth evenly, it leaves the equal distribution up to justified alignment.</p>\n\n<h3>Center Align</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">This is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes.</p>\n\n<h3>Right Align</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">This is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it\'s views. It\'s prefers to not be told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it\'s a pretty good shot from at least four or five football fields away. Dead on. So boss.</p>\n\n<h3>Justify Align</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake. Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it\'s place and not all cattywampus like the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend to put off more of an elitist attitude.</p>","Markup: Text Alignment","","inherit","closed","closed","","1176-revision-v1","","","2018-08-07 18:47:06","2018-08-07 18:47:06","",1176,"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/1176-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0),

(1783,1,"2018-08-07 18:50:37","2018-08-07 18:50:37","All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, \"Oh, why can\'t you remain like this for ever!\" This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nMrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children\'s minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.\n\nIf you could keep awake (but of course you can\'t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.\n\nI don\'t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person\'s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child\'s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.\n\nOf course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John\'s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other\'s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.\n\nOf all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.\n\nOccasionally in her travels through her children\'s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael\'s minds, while Wendy\'s began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.","Post Format: Standard","","inherit","closed","closed","","358-revision-v1","","","2018-08-07 18:50:37","2018-08-07 18:50:37","",358,"http://carnivalmeetingscom.local/358-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0),
